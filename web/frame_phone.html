<h1>Phone Info</h1>

<p>The phone that I'm using for this project is the 
<a href=http://www.sonyericsson.com/t300/>Sony Ericsson T300</a>.
The T300 is a fist generation picture phone that's being sold as
the entry-level phone for all the new T-mobile services 
(text messaging, picture mail, and Internet access). Unlike some
other new phones, the camera is not integrated into the phone-
you have to plug a special camera module into the base of the
phone.</p>

<h2>The Phone</h2>

<p>The phone part of the T300 is your basic, modern cell phone. On
the RF side of things, it's tri-band GSM, so you can take it 
with you to Europe (and pay outrageous surcharges). It also talks
GPRS, WAP, and SMS, so you can do nerdy things with it, like check
your email, get on the web, or send/receive text messages. I currently
have a low opinion of these survices, as the data speeds are slow
and the interface is 10x worse than a PDA (which is 10x worse than
a PC). The display, of course, is part of the problem- while it
looks nice with it's 256 colors, it just isn't detailed enough to
display that much information. However, it is the right size for
normal cell-phone tasks, and it doesn't seem to kill the battery
too much.

<p>Physically, the phone feels kind of hollow and a little 
cheap. It's about the right size though, and is a good balance
between being large enough to hold when in use, and small enough
to fit in a pocket. Like other phones, you can replace the
face plate of the phone with one of a different color or 
style. Mine came in the "redneck-motorboat-sparkly-green" color.
Yeah, and I give a rip about that.</p>

<h2>The Camera</h2>
<p>Like I said earlier, the T300 has a camera option that plugs into
the base of the phone. The camera sells for about $50, but usually they 
give it to you for free (along with a carying pouch that hooks onto
a keychain). I'm not sure, but I think the camera has a resolution
of about 640x480, and enough flash memory to store about five pictures
at that resolution. It has an "optical viewfinder", which is just
a glass window below the sensor. Personally, I think they could
have done without the viewfinder, as it adds to the size of
the module. Plus, when you're about to take a picture, 
preview data is displayed on the 
phone's display screen at a couple frames per second, anyways.</p>

<p>One of the painful things about the camera attachment is that it
plugs into the phone through that standard cell-phone connector at the
bottom of the phone. I think this thing is just a slow, serial link
(9600 baud?). In any case it takes a long freaking time to move data
from the camera to the phone.</p>

<h2>Taking a Picture</h2>

<p>Taking a picture is a bit of a painful process. First you obviously
have to plug the camera attachment into the phone. Every time I do this, 
I wonder how long it will be before the pins on the attachment will
wear off. The damage may already be taking place- sometimes when
I plug the camera in the phone doesn't notice anything (it should
pop up camera options on the screen). Sigh..</p>

<p>The second step is actually taking a pictures. In theory, one could
look through the optical viewfinder to take the picture. However, the
viewfinder is at the bottom end of the (now foot-long) camera. Doing
this makes me feel like a dork, because it looks like you're lookking
through a parascope or something. Therefore, I usually just stick with
looking at the phone's display to line up a picture. The on-screen
preview is <b>awfull</b>- the resolution and colors are reduced, and
the display lags by about a half second. It's good enough though. At 
some point you press the camera button to take the picture,
meanwhile  hoping that the force of pressing the button doesn't cause
the camera module to become unplugged.</p>

<p>Ahh done! Right? Well, not really. Now you've got to transfer the 
picture from the camera attachment to the phone. This takes some time-
maybe about a minute for a 640x480 picture. During this time you have
to be carefull with the phone- if the camera module becomes unplugged,
you lose everything. When it finally finishes, all you have to do is..
preview the pic, tell the phone to send the message to an email address,
wait for the phone to encode the picture as a mime attachment, pick
an email address, and have the phone send the email as data. The data 
upload takes a while, and requires that you be somewhere that supports
the phone's data services (that's usually most places that the phone 
works). If the phone can't send the message, it thankfully keeps a copy
of it that you can send later.</p>

<h2>My Opinion?</h2>
<p>There are a <b>lot</b> of things that can be improved on with the
T300. The image quality is pretty crappy, having the camera as a
plugin module sucks, and the data transfer times are terrible. I also
think the TV ads for these picture phones are <b>incredibly misleading</b>.
They show happy-go-lucky yuppies snapping shots of each other (and the 
hedgehogs in their pants?) and emailing them away like crazy. I
am confident that normal guys like my dad would be extremely
disappointed in the amount of effort required to send a picture,
and the quality of the picture.</p>

<p>With that said, the camera phone does do what it's supposed to do
if you have the patience. I think these things are awfully cool,
and I can see how creative folks will find new and cool things to
do with the technology. For my boring life, a camera phone is kind
of overkill, but on the bright side of things, I can use it and the
tmobile blog stuff to take snippets of my life and post them, more
frequently than I would with just the normal blog stuff.</p>
